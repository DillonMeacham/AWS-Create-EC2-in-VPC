<h1>Launch an EC2 Instance in a VPC</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, Alfredo of Alfredo's Pizza is looking to set up a website to advertise his business. To help him out, I created a custom virtual private cloud (VPC), subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), routes and an internet gateway, as well as adding a security group. <br />


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>AWS Management Console</b> (21H2)
